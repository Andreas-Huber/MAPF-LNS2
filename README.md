MAPF-LNS2: Fast Repairing for Multi-Agent Path Finding via Large Neighborhood Search


MAPF-LNS2 is an efficient algorithm for solving Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). 

The code requires the external libraries 
BOOST (https://www.boost.org/) and Eigen (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/). 
After you installed both libraries and downloaded the source code, 
go into the directory of the source code and compile it with CMake: 
```
cmake .
make
```

Then, you are able to run the code:
```
./lns -m random-32-32-20.map -a random-32-32-20-random-1.scen -o test.csv -k 400 -t 300
```

- m: the map file from the MAPF benchmark
- a: the scenario file from the MAPF benchmark
- o: the output file
- k: the number of agents
- t: the runtime limit

You can find more details and explanations for all parameters with:
```
./lns --help
```

We provide example instance files "random-32-32-20.map" and "random-32-32-20-random-1.scen" in the repo, 
but more instances can be download from the MAPF benchmark (https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf/index.html).
All the experiments in the paper used in instances from the benchmark except for Experiment 5, 
for which the instances are in folder "instances".

The software was developed by Jiaoyang Li and Zhe Chen based on [MAPF-LNS](https://github.com/Jiaoyang-Li/MAPF-LNS).

The rule-based MAPF solvers (i.e., PPS, PIBT, and winPIBT) inside the software were borrowed from 
https://github.com/Kei18/pibt/tree/v1.3
